# Travis-CI Stuff
For Signing:
- http://www.objc.io/issues/6-build-tools/travis-ci/
For releasing:
- https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release
- What you would need to do is check if the release already exists, if so delete it and then create a new one.
- A couple ideas of how to do this:
-   Only at the head of each branch
-   Or you could keep adding files of archives to the branch release tag.

This guy has great writeup of his Makefile
